# of-the-stars.net

This is the repo for my personal website [of-the-stars.net](https://of-the-stars.net). 

Currently built using [Zola](https://getzola.org/) and hosted on [Neocities](https://neocities.org/), although I may change the hosting solution in the future. Currently very happy with Neocities though, it's a project worth supporting!

Currently on version v0.2.0. I'm using semantic versioning, but without any public-facing part of my site besides its content, I really don't know why I am.
