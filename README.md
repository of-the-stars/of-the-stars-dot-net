# of-the-stars.net

This is the repo for my personal website [of-the-stars.net](https://of-the-stars.net). Currently built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and hosted on [Neocities](https://neocities.org/), although both are subject to change :)

This is currently v0.1.0., wherein I've got a real basic thing going. Next on my to-do list is to begin planning a roadmap of things I'd like to add, since I plan on making this site the main focal point of my public-facing online presence.
