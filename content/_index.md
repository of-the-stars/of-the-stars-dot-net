Hello there! I'm Stellae. It means "of the stars" in Latin.

I'm still settling in here, but my main interests are Nix, low-level programming, and programs that look cool and work well. At the moment,you may see my name under a commit here and there as I dip my toes into contributing to the projects I use often. I also shoot MiniDV, play guitar, and write a little. I'm a part of the site team for [kglw.net](https://kglw.net), the King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard fan site.

I care deeply about FOSS, using technology to help others, and the democratization of knowledge. I fight for the users!
