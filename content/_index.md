Hello there! My name is Stellae. It means "Of The Stars" in Latin. :]

My main interests are Nix, low-level programming, and programs that look cool and work well. I also shoot [MiniDV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DV_(video_format)), play guitar, and write a little. I'm a part of the site team for [kglw.net](https://kglw.net), the King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard fan site.

I care deeply about FOSS, using technology to help others, and the democratization of knowledge. I fight for the users!
