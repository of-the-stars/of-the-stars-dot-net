I must admit this whole endeavor is a bit intimidating.

I've only been writing consistently for about a year and a half now. Leading up to now, I've been trying to journal on a daily basis. Writing about myself and for myself has been an enlightening experience, which I treasure dearly. To be honest, I wouldn't have this perspective if it weren't for a writing class I took my first semester of college that changed how I viewed the actual writing process. It helped make me comfortable with the idea of writing as an actual process, as opposed to something you just do. Since then, I've beein toying with the idea of creating and publishing more long form content. This blog is an experiment and learning experience designed to do exactly that.

Being an experiment, I expect a lot of what I do and how I go about it to change. I'm likely to tweak my text editor, [neovim](https://neovim.io/) to be more comfortable with writing long-form english language content. Having an autocomplete with suggested words would be quite nice, beyond the ones I do get as [blink.cmp](https://github.com/Saghen/blink.cmp) scrambles to predict what I'm typing using what I've written elsewhere in the file. I may incorporate [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and turn this place into more of a 'digital garden'. Then again, I might simply migrate to a different static site generator besides [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and stick with it till the day no one is left to speak time's name. I know that the only reason I'm not using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is because of its Ruby-forged dependency hell.

Expect this site to change often. That is a good thing. Publishing a new post is change. I will certainly tweak the colorscheme and the layout incrementally. As I become more comfortable with my workflow, I foresee this whole blogging thing to become a big part of my online activity, which would be desireable. Much better than doomscrolling. Until then, may the stars shine favorably on you, dear reader.
